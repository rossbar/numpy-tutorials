The dataset contains 60,000 training and 10,000 test images and corresponding labels. Each training and test image is of size 784 (or 28x28 pixels) — this will be your input for the neural network. \n",

The final output of the network is a vector of 10 scores — one for each handwritten digit image. You will also evaluate how good your model is at classifying the images on the test set.\n",
